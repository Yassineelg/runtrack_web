# Job 01 - Creating a Basic HTML Page

In this task, you are required to create an HTML page with essential elements: DOCTYPE, html, head, title, and body.

### Questions:

1. Why are the `<title>` and `<meta>` tags essential for SEO?

   - The `<title>` tag is crucial for SEO because it defines the title of the web page displayed in search engine results. It provides a concise description of the page's content, which can improve click-through rates.

   - The `<meta>` tags, particularly the `<meta name="description">` and `<meta name="keywords">` tags, provide additional metadata about the page's content. Search engines may use this information to understand the page's topic and relevance to search queries.

2. What impact do they have on a search engine's perception of your site?

   - The `<title>` tag influences a search engine's perception by serving as the primary identifier for the page in search results. It helps search engines understand the content's context and relevance to user queries.

   - `<meta>` tags, such as `<meta name="description">` and `<meta name="keywords">`, provide additional context and keywords that can help search engines better categorize and rank the page in search results.

3. What is the role of the DOCTYPE declaration in HTML?

   - The DOCTYPE declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) specifies the document type and version of HTML used in a web page. It serves as a signal to web browsers about how to render the page and ensures proper compliance with HTML standards.

   - It also helps browsers differentiate between different versions of HTML and enables them to render the page correctly, ensuring consistency in how web content is displayed.
