# Job 04 - Adding Images and Video with alt Attribute

In this task, you integrated an image with the `alt` attribute and a video with controls into an HTML page. Additionally, we discussed the importance of the `alt` attribute for images and its influence on accessibility and SEO.

### Questions:

1. Why is it crucial to add an `alt` attribute to your images?

   - The `alt` attribute is crucial for images because it provides alternative text that describes the image's content or purpose. When an image cannot be displayed or seen by a user, the `alt` attribute ensures that there is a text-based description available to convey the image's meaning.

   - Accessibility: The `alt` attribute is a fundamental component of web accessibility. It benefits users with disabilities, such as those using screen readers or browsers that don't display images. The alternative text helps these users understand the content and context of the image.

   - SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines rely on the `alt` attribute to understand the content of images on a webpage. Including relevant and descriptive `alt` text can improve the SEO of your site by making it more accessible and understandable to search engine crawlers.

   - User Experience: Even for users without disabilities, descriptive `alt` text enhances the user experience by providing additional context or information about the image.

2. How does adding the `alt` attribute influence the accessibility and SEO of your site?

   - Accessibility: Adding the `alt` attribute makes your website more accessible to users with disabilities. Screen readers can read the alternative text aloud, allowing visually impaired users to understand the content and purpose of images. This contributes to a more inclusive and user-friendly experience.

   - SEO: Search engines use the `alt` attribute to index and rank images in search results. Well-crafted `alt` text can enhance the discoverability of your content and potentially drive more organic traffic to your website. It's important to use relevant keywords in `alt` text when appropriate to improve SEO.
