# Job 02 - Structuring Content with Semantic HTML Tags

In this task, you structured the content of an HTML page using semantic HTML tags, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.

### Questions:

1. Why is it important to use semantic HTML tags?

   - Semantic HTML tags are essential because they provide meaning and structure to the content of a web page. They convey the intended purpose of different sections and elements within the page, making it easier for both browsers and assistive technologies (like screen readers) to understand and interpret the content correctly.

   - Semantic tags also improve the overall maintainability and readability of the code by making it more self-explanatory. Developers can quickly identify the purpose of each section, which aids in collaboration and future updates.

2. How does using semantic HTML tags enhance SEO (Search Engine Optimization)?

   - Using semantic HTML tags improves SEO because search engines rely on the structure and semantics of a web page to understand its content and context. Semantic tags make it clear which parts of the page are headers, navigation menus, main content, sidebars, and footers.

   - Search engines can use this structural information to better index and rank the page in search results. For example, using `<header>` and `<nav>` tags tells search engines that these sections contain essential information about the page, improving the page's visibility in relevant search queries.

3. How does using semantic HTML tags enhance accessibility?

   - Semantic HTML tags greatly enhance accessibility by providing a logical and hierarchical structure to the content. This structure is crucial for users who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to navigate and understand web content.

   - Screen readers can interpret semantic tags and convey the page's structure to users, making it easier for them to navigate, comprehend, and interact with the content. For example, a screen reader can announce that a certain section is a navigation menu or a main content area, improving the user experience for people with disabilities.
