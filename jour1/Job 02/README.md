# Job 02

In this task, we're structuring our web page using semantic HTML elements. We're building a "One Piece Fan Page" to engage and inform fellow fans of this epic anime and manga series.

## HTML Structure

We've used a clean and semantic HTML structure for our One Piece Fan Page:

- The `<header>` section welcomes visitors to the "New World."
- The `<nav>` section contains navigation links to different sections of the page.
- The `<main>` section holds the primary content of the page, with articles for character introductions, the story overview, and information about episodes.
- The `<aside>` section provides supplementary information about why we love One Piece, fun facts, and additional insights.
- The `<footer>` section includes a copyright notice and an invitation to set sail and live the dream.

## Meta Tags

To enhance the webpage's SEO and user experience, we've added meta tags:

- `<meta name="description">`: Provides a brief description of the page's content for search engines and users.
- `<meta name="keywords">`: Lists relevant keywords related to One Piece to improve discoverability.

## Favicon

We've also included a custom favicon for a personalized touch, making our fan page more recognizable in the browser tab.

## Improvements

In the `<aside>` section, we've provided additional information about One Piece, shared interesting facts, and invited users to join the Straw Hat Pirates' adventure. This enhances engagement and provides fans with more reasons to explore the series.

Remember to update the content and structure as needed to create an engaging and informative One Piece Fan Page that resonates with fellow fans worldwide!

Feel free to add more content, images, or personalized touches to make your fan page even more unique and exciting.

Enjoy building your One Piece Fan Page!
