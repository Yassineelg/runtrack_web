# Job 07 - Creating Ordered and Unordered Lists in HTML

In this task, you've learned how to create both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists in HTML and explored scenarios where you might choose one over the other.

### Questions:

1. When Should You Use an Ordered List Instead of an Unordered List?

   - Ordered lists (`<ol>`) are typically used when you want to present information in a specific sequence or order. This is common when you have a list of steps, instructions, or items that have a natural order. For example, a recipe with sequential cooking steps or a tutorial with numbered instructions.

   - Unordered lists (`<ul`>) are preferred when the order of items doesn't matter, and you want to present a list of items without any particular sequence. They are commonly used for listing items, features, or advantages where the order is not important.

   - To summarize, use an ordered list when the sequence matters, and opt for an unordered list when the order of items is irrelevant.

By understanding the appropriate use of ordered and unordered lists, you can effectively structure and present information on your web pages to improve readability and user experience.
